# Learning Project - Brain Games

This is the first training project as part of the Hexlet course in the frontend developer profession. 
The project consists of five console games written on javascript. 

## Game: "Even-parity check"

The user is shown a random number. The user has to answer **yes** if the number is even, or **no** if it is odd.

## Game: "Calculator"

The user is shown a random mathematical expression, e.g. **35 + 16**, which must be **calculated** and the correct answer written down.

## Game: "GCD"
The user is shown two random numbers, e.g. **25 50**. The user has to calculate and enter the **greatest common divisor** of these numbers.

## Game "Arithmetic progression"

Show the player a series of numbers forming an **arithmetic progression**, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player has to identify this **number**.

## Game: "Is the number prime?"

The player is shown a random number and must answer whether it **is prime** or not.
