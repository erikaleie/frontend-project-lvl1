# Learning Project - Brain Games

This is the first training project as part of the Hexlet course in the frontend developer profession. 
The project consists of five console games written in Javascript. 

## Game: "Even-parity check"

The player is shown a random number. The user has to answer **yes** if the number is even, or **no** if it is odd.  
Enter `brain-even` to start the game.

## Game: "Calculator"

The player is shown a random mathematical expression, e.g. **35 + 16**, which must be **calculated** and the correct answer written down.  
Enter `brain-calc` to start the game.

## Game: "GCD"
The player is shown two random numbers, e.g. **25 50**. The user has to calculate and enter the **greatest common divisor** of these numbers.  
Enter `brain-gcd` to start the game.

## Game "Arithmetic progression"

The player is shown a series of numbers forming an **arithmetic progression**, replacing one of the numbers with two dots. The player has to identify this **number**.  
Enter `brain-even` to start the game.
